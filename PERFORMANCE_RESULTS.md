----------------------------------------------------------------------
100KB      | 1.23           | 12.75          | CPU         | 0.10x
1MB        | 12.52          | 15.01          | CPU         | 0.83x  
10MB       | 105.03         | 31.68          | GPU         | 3.32x
50MB       | 502.12         | 114.60         | GPU         | 4.38x
